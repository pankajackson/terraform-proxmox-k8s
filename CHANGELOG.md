## [0.0.3] - 2026-11-11

### Added

- Added the VM public SSH key to the `secrets` output

### Changed

---

## [0.0.2] - 2026-05-17

### Added

- Added support for Proxmox VM tags using `cluster.tags`
- Added support for reusing existing Proxmox cloud images
- Added configurable image download behavior:
  - `os.image.download`
  - `os.image.overwrite`
  - `os.image.overwrite_unmanaged`
- Added validation for `addons.nfs_storage`
- Added structured outputs:
  - `cluster`
  - `access`
  - `secrets`

### Changed

- Removed dependency on shared NFS storage for cluster bootstrap
- Cluster join metadata and kubeconfig are now coordinated using Terraform state
- Refactored resource dependencies to reduce unnecessary destruction/recreation
- Simplified bootstrap lifecycle and provisioning flow
- Improved module portability by removing external shared storage requirements
- Updated README and examples to reflect new architecture

### Removed

- Removed mandatory shared NFS requirement for kubeconfig/join command distribution

### Notes

This release significantly simplifies deployment architecture.

Previous versions required shared NFS storage between nodes to exchange:

- K3s join command
- kubeconfig
- bootstrap metadata

The module now stores and manages bootstrap state directly in Terraform state, making the module fully self-contained.

NFS is now only required when using the optional `addons.nfs_storage` addon.
